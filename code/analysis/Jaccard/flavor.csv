The 2009 Vivens delivers the ripeness of that vintage without being overdone or flamboyant. Enrobed in the plush tannins that are the signature of Margaux, it is “forward” and easy to enjoy now, yet has adequate structure so it doesn’t come across as a “fruit bomb.” It finishes with a hint of earthiness that adds complexity.---- Michael Apstein","2025-02-02T10:13:21.096488Z"

In contrast to some 2017 vintage wines that lacked concentration, Clos Saint Martin boasts a richness that doesn’t pale in comparison to its grander vintages.

Intriguingly, Haut-Bailly commanded prices equal to Lafite, Latour, Margaux, and Haut-Brion in the 19th century. Owned since 1955 by Belgian negociant Daniel Sanders, in 1998, Haut-Bailly was purchased by American Robert G. Wilmers, but Veronique Sanders continues to steer the cru classé estate to greatness, year after year. The 74-hectare lies in the heart of gravelly Pessac-Leognan, and the 2018 vintage blends 55% cabernet sauvignon with 35% merlot and equal soupcons of petit verdot and cabernet franc. The estate's core is 10 acres of 100 year old vines, concentrated further this vintage with yields around 20 ha/hl. Complex, perfumed, and mesmerizing creme de cassis, ripe cherries, fine oak spice, mocha, and dusty minerals, it is unbelievably cohesive now, a testament to the excellent 2018 vintage. The wine is structured for long and graceful ageing, as only great classic claret can do. This vintage commands $275, and it is worth every penny. Be disciplined and let evolve for a few years.

Château La Tour-Figeac is one of sixty or so estates with the Grand Cru Classé designation. Located between Châteaux Cheval-Blanc and Figeac, La Tour Figeac comes from a very fine neighborhood indeed. Until 1879, in fact, the estate was part of Figeac. Their 2018 is one of the best renditions of the past few decades. It shows a classic Saint Emilion style with black cherry, blackberry and a touch of red cherry fruit aromas enhanced by elements of roasted coffee, cocoa, violets, herbs and toasty oak. A blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Franc, it displays flavors that are round, elegant and supple, with layers of plush black and red fruits interwoven with the herb, vanilla, cocoa and spice tones. The wine exhibits a harmonious style even in its youth, and the 2018 Château La Tour-Figeac will provide delicious drinking for the next twenty years and beyond.---- Wayne Belding","2025-02-02T18:11:24.404967Z"

Compared to some vintages with more noble rots, the aromas are fresher and purer in the vintage of 2018.

I am deeply surprised by its highly concentrated sweetness (with 145 g/l residual sugar.) The total acidity is not very high, but the palate is magically balanced from head to toe, thanks to Yquem’s taller and lingering expression.","2025-02-02T18:32:35.184385Z"

He is famous for the excellent wine he produced at Clos L’Eglise in Pomerol, but he also bought lesser known vineyards and upgraded the farming and winemaking to produce some world-class value in Lalande-de-Pomerol, here at Les Cruzelles as well as at Le Chanade. I understand that his daughters have taken over daily operations and winemaking duties. This is a blend of mostly Merlot with 20% Cabernet Franc which was aged in about 1/3 new oak. Intense black raspberry aromas subsume the oak at this point in time. I have had younger bottles closer to release where the plush fruit intensity might lull one into thinking that this was a plump, early drinking example showcasing the generosity of the 2019 vintage. With another year of bottle age this is more overt with its inherent structure. Its combination of dark, plush fruit and superb structure declare this an excellently balanced wine which is both accessible now and which should age well for decades.---- Andrew Holod","2025-02-02T19:12:41.328341Z"

Incredibly, this biodynamic winery manages to deliver such a stable and exceptional performance in the challenging vintage of 2021. After swirling the glass, this wine reveals distinct aromas of sour plum, red dates, roses, and red cherries, as clear as strands of beauty’s hair. The palate is accompanied by a gentle roundness, crafting an exquisitely beautiful mouth feeling. Closing my eyes, it feels as if I am being caressed by a gentle spring rain.

Tasting this wine is akin to biting into a multi-layered cake, especially one filled with chilled honey. Initially timid, the aromas blossom after swirling, revealing complex scents of syrup pear, acacia honey, shiitake mushrooms, and ice-skin mooncakes. The spicy notes of ginger and Sichuan pepper lend an ideal rhythmic sensation to the wine, while the acidity towards the finish creates a refined, elegant profile. In my view, this is a luxuriously sweet, yet warmly delicate and smooth top-tier sweet wine.
